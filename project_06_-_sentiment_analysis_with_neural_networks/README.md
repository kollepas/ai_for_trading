# Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks
---
> Create a Neural Network deep learning model to classify the sentiment of StockTwits messages.

## Overview
---
In the **Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks** project a deep learning model is built to classify the sentiment of messages from [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/), a social network for investors and traders. The model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols will be generated. The training and testing data is packed in [twits.rar](https://github.com/kollepas/ai_for_trading/blob/master/project_06_-_sentiment_analysis_with_neural_networks/twits.rar) file.

## Installation
---
- Clone/Download the folder.
- Unrar the _twits.rar_ file using 'Extract Here'.
- The project is in the [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/kollepas/ai_for_trading/blob/master/project_06_-_sentiment_analysis_with_neural_networks/project_06_-_sentiment_analysis_with_neural_networks.ipynb).
- Unlike most other projects, this one has no _requirements.txt_ file attached to it. Beside the basic 'standard' Python packages, `nltk` and `torch` must be installed.

## How to use?
---
Open the [Jupyter Notebook file](https://github.com/kollepas/ai_for_trading/blob/master/project_06_-_sentiment_analysis_with_neural_networks/project_06_-_sentiment_analysis_with_neural_networks.ipynb) and run through the code blocks. The notebook itself comes with detailed explanation about each step.
