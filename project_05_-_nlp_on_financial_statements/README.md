# NLP on Financial Statements
---
> Create an NLP Analysis on 10-k financial statements to generate an alpha factor.

## Overview
---
In the **NLP on Financial Statements** project the SEC website is accessed to download annual 10-k filings and extract key sections for NLP (natural language processing) analysis. A text based stock selection model is created which is originally described in an academic paper called [Lazy Prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1658471). For the dataset, end of day quotes from Quotemedia and Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists are used.
