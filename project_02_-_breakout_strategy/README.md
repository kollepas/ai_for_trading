# Breakout Strategy
---
> Create a long/short portfolio based on a high-low vs. current price indicator and calculate the performance and some statistics to detect outliers.

## Overview
---
In the **Breakout Strategy** project, highs and lows over a certain time period relative to their current price are used to examine which stocks out of a universe should be gone long (buy) or short (sell). It also includes a performance evaluation and statistical tests (Q-Q plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to conclude how the returns are distributed and to detect outliers. For the dataset, end of day quotes from Quotemedia are used.
