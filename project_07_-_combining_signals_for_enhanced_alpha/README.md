# Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha
---
> Combine signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha.

## Overview
---
In the **Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha** project different signals are combined in a random forest model to enhance alpha. The project also covers techniques to overcome the problem of overlapping samples and overfitting. The `zipline` package will take care of the handling and accessing of the data. For the dataset, end of day quotes from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar are used.
